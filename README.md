## Reinforcement Learning - Basab Dattaray

### Running the Demos
The demos are available in the package ws/demos. Steps:
1. Download from the Github url: https://github.com/basab-dattaray
2. Navigate to the folder ws/demos
3. Run the demos from an IDE - tested on JetBrains PyCharm

### Summary
This Github site was inspired by Keon Kim's sample code organization structure where different RL algorithms applied to different environments were grouped.
Here Reinforcement Learning (RL) ideas from various sources (including Keon's great reference Github code) were reconstructed to form a common framework using a functional programming style (although for practical reasons, not using the pure functional programming paradigm) so that one can add essential content  without having to understand the common boilerplate code anew for each demo/app.
Instead, developers can focus on the key ingredients that differentiate their contributions.
from previous work.

The primary objective for this framework is to introduce modularity and configurability while reducing coupling across cohesive packages/modules. At the highest level of abstraction, the agent and environment were cleanly separated into their own packages.
For the sake of expediency, code libraries previously written were reused.

The ultimate hope is that all of us can learn and contribute towards a better understanding of the plethora of basic theories and techniques that have been established and continue to be developed by pioneers in the dynamic and exciting field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Perhaps a framework like this will enable practitioners in the RL field to understand the tradeoffs in picking different approaches to solve problems.
